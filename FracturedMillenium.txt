Hypocrisy didn't release lyrics back in the day. Here's a fairly good interpretation of Fractured Millenium. Thanks to fein19 for most of this. 


FRACTURED MILLENIUM:

Yeah!!!
I came from second universe, I've traveled far
I'm a God, I'm not pleased
Is this the way you're supposed to be?

You're free from the game
Doesn't anyone care anymore?

Killing your own world, there's nothing to stop you
Can't you see what you're doing?
Its got an end or nothing will be left!

Dying planet
Mother nature bleeding, she will die
Crying planet
Burning ice and toxic plundering   (possible: Burning lives and torching wilderness)

I'm screaming all inside but there's no one around
   (Small possibility, would fit next line better: As the hammer fall(s) into but there's no one around / nowhere to run)
Bringing me my death or do you acquit? -No!

Ready to strike back, ready for death
Armageddon waits near
For your own selfish path, you gotta go on 'til you die

For our new religion: 
money and power is all you bring/breed
Praying to God who don't exist
Can't you see what you're doing? It's gotta end or nothing will be there

Dying planet
Mother nature bleeding, she will die
Crying planet
Burning ice and toxic plundering
